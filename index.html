                <p class="lead text-muted">HDC has been researched and studied for many years and it is presently in use
                    worldwide, mostly in wastewater treatment facilities. The HDC results have been far more effective
                    than any other water sanitation and purification systems used today. The natural Phenomenon of
                    Hydrodynamic Cavitation (HDC) helps sanitize the water through the heat signature it creates inside
                    the device, dismantling many toxic pathogens and microorganisms passing through it's chamber. HDC
                    dismantles these unwanted items in the water by removing the Hydrogen and or Oxygen atoms attached
                    to and making up the Molecule therefor said molecule no longer exists.
                    HDC also changes the molecular structure of the water into a "restructured" negatively ionic charged
                    body of water, when used as directed. With the waters transformed, the HDC Device helps naturally
                    reduce the need for Chlorine and other harmful chemicals in any body of water. It provides a natural
                    'Trifecta' outcome; that helps to sanitize, purify, and balance the water chemistry on any body of
                    water it is installed on.

                                    <p class="card-text">The technology in the HDC Device creates a significant
                                        differential in pressure inside the chamber of the device. As your existing pump
                                        is pumping water through the HDC Device a high percentage of the water will
                                        convert itself from a liquid to a gas. Said gas is in the form of bubbles and
                                        then the bubbles will then collapse (Cavitate) and return to a liquid and exit
                                        the device. While in the collapsing(cavitating) process or action temperatures
                                        in the collapsing bubbles will exceed 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This heat that is
                                        naturally created is what breaks down the molecules of the items we all trying
                                        to get out of any given body of water the HDC Device is installed onto.</p>

                                industry and is measured in + - mv.
                                The best definition of “ORP" is that the higher the ORP in a body of water indicates an

                                with a 20-gallon fresh water holding tank. I have had it for years and I often take the
                                boat to the outer Islands (36 Miles) to guide canoe paddlers and open water swimmers.
                                When I would fill my tank with shore water, it would go bad in 3 to 4 days. 6 months
                                ago, I decided to take water from my swimming pool that has the HDC Water Filtration
                                Device on it (the pool has never been better with nearly 0 Chemicals) and fill the tank
                                in my boat with said water. This water will stay nice and clean for roughly 4 WEEKS now.
                                Other boaters have come to my house and picked up the water for their boats and they all
                                love it.

                                spas is not Chlorine at all. It is called "Chloramines" and they are the bi product of
                                chlorine doing its job to destroy impurities in the water. The HDC destroys the
                                impurities in the water without the use of as much chlorine therefor the smell is
                                reduced or eliminated. Chloramines have been linked to many health issues including lung
                                issues for years. When you have a pool or spa disinfected with the help of the HDC unit
                                you are swimming in a much cleaner and safer pool or spa for you whole family!
