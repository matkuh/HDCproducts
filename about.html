                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item"> I’m a water molecule, swimming happily down the stream with all my
                        buddies; we do sort of an underwater do-se-do dance where we all swirl around holding hands with
                        a few partners at once and continually change partners. </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">We understand that the wider the river we flow down, the slower we flow,
                        and that as the river narrows we have to speed up - makes sense. But we’ve heard there is a
                        ridiculous-sounding law of physics that governs our behavior that doesn’t seem to make sense,
                        even though it is the reason that birds and airplanes can fly - the Bernoulli Principle - says
                        that "as we speed up the pressure goes down".
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">I guess we will find if that’s really true soon enough because whoops,
                        the walls of the pipe we are swimming through are getting narrower and so we have to speed up to
                        get thorough. Yes, now it is getting harder and harder to hold on to our neighbors hands, and
                        WOW, suddenly we are flying through space by ourselves, hardly touching at all - me and my
                        nearby friends have exploded into a bubble of water vapor - we were flowing so fast that the
                        pressure has decreased to a vacuum like in outer space and we have boiled at room temperature.
                        But this is actually not too bad, it is fun, especially because the sudden decrease in pressure
                        has caused all those nasty bacteria that were bothering us by swimming alongside to explode,
                        with their guts flying all around.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"> Whoops again, now the walls of the pipe have suddenly gotten further
                        away, and we are caught out here as a bubble of vapor swimming at a lower speed again because
                        the stream has gotten wider and uh oh, we are suddenly caught with our pants and panties down
                        because we can no longer exist as a vapor at this higher pressure and our universe is rapidly
                        contracting - ouch - we have suddenly imploded back into liquid water, bashing all our hands
                        together so violently that some of us break up into free radicals - not all of us luckily, I’m
                        still intact, but some of my previous buddies are now acting very radically, attacking
                        everything in sight, and breaking up all the other kinds of molecules that were flowing with us,
                        like chloramines and other bad actors, breaking them down into CO2 and new water molecules.
